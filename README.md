## How I Work

- I care deeply about **code readability** and long-term maintainability
- I prefer **simple solutions** over clever ones
- I design components and modules with **clear boundaries**
- I’m comfortable refactoring existing code to improve structure and clarity
- I value collaboration, feedback, and continuous learning

---

## Engineering Mindset

- Write code for humans first, machines second
- Favor predictable data flow and explicit state management
- Reduce complexity early before it compounds
- Treat bugs as system feedback, not failures
- Always leave the codebase better than I found it
